The resources of the ICA, its Universal Declaration on Archives, its 1996 Code of Ethics have underpinned the principles of this guidebook, especially its code of ethics. As part of this project, the Archives at NCBS undertook two distinct tasks. The first was the development of guides on the legal frameworks that apply to archives in India. The second was the development of an ethical code that works together with the legal framework to help archivists make decisions in archival work that are both legal and ethical.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-01/1-1-appraisals":{"id":"chapter-01/1-1-appraisals","title":"Appraisals","description":"The process of acquisition of archival records begins with the appraisal of records suitable for archiving. For public institutions like the National Archives of India or other institutions covered under the Public Records Act, there are specific legal considerations to follow for appraisal and accessioning as laid down in various laws and governmental circulars and manuals.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-01/1-2-acquisitions":{"id":"chapter-01/1-2-acquisitions","title":"Acquisitions","description":"Scenario: The archive of an institution receives a \u2018donation\u2019 of records from the legal heirs of a former scientist who was an employee. The records contain manuscripts, photographs, film and other material owned by the scientist. The archive would like to add these records to its collection, and obtain title and ownership over the records to provide access to researchers. How might the archive go about obtaining title to the records, and what are the legal mechanisms for acquisition that they should be aware of?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-01/content":{"id":"chapter-01/content","title":"Acquisitions and Appraisals","description":"This chapter covers acquisitions, donations, deeds of gift, sale deeds, loans, copyright licenses and copyright assignments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Archives and archival practice occupy a peculiar place among law, regulation and policy in India. Archives of all kinds have existed in India for decades. Besides the National Archives and various state archives administered by governments, there are organisational archives of corporations, scientific labs, newspapers or even individuals and families. But they have received scant attention from lawmakers, policymakers or the legal academy, as an institution that deserves specific legislative or policy consideration. Despite their significance as institutions of historical and political importance, archives and archival practice in India remain unacknowledged and understudied as an object of legal enquiry, as well as a subject of public policy. Yet, despite this conspicuous absence of \u2018The Archive\u2019 as a distinct subject of regulation, archival practice intersects with the law and regulation of property, media and information in distinct ways.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
