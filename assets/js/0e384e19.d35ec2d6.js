Scant attention has been paid by institutions of law and policy, or the legal academy, towards understanding archives in their broader social role as institutions that promote access to knowledge, information and education, and how the law shapes this role of archives. In particular, the activities of non-government archives in preserving and providing access to records of enduring value \u2013 carried out today by a plethora of non-government actors and institutions, including corporations, universities, private societies or communities \u2013 has received almost no attention as a matter of legal policy, or from the legal academy.
