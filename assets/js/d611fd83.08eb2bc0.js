For public institutions like the National Archives of India or other institutions covered under the Public Records Act, there are specific legal considerations to follow for appraisal and accessioning as laid down in various laws and governmental circulars and manuals.\nFor the most part, there are no legal mandates for preservation for the records of private institutions. As such, appraisal and accessioning of records should ideally be determined through an established process and policy of appraisal and documentation of its institutional records, including the creation of records retention schedules.1 One area where such appraisals may raise legal issues is in the determination of institutional records, as distinguished from the personal papers of employees. In general, for all records and material created in the course of employment, title and ownership rests with the employer.2\nAccording to the Copyright Act, copyright of all records and material authored by employees as part of their duties and obligations as an employee would vest in the employer. A key question in appraising the papers of an employee would therefore be to determine whether the record in question can be construed as a part of their contractual duties, or within the scope of their employment. If the record in question does not pertain to their duties as an employee, the record and the copyright therein may fall outside of the scope of institutional records, and the title and copyright over such records would have to be cleared separately by the institution. For example, if a person employed as a scientist happens to create a painting or artwork unrelated to the terms of their employment, the institution or employee cannot claim ownership over such work.\nDetermining whether a particular work has been produced in the \u2018scope of employment\u2019 depends on the nature and degree of control exerted by an employer over the creation of that particular work, which has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a lecturer is directed by their employer (say, an academic institution) to prepare a presentation on a particular subject, in a particular place and in a particular manner (or \u2018what, how when and where\u2019), it may be construed to be a relationship of employment, where the ownership of the presentation could vest in the institution. Determining whether particular copyrighted material was produced \u2018in the course of employment\u2019 is a contextual exercise. However, the law generally favours the authors of the work over the employer, unless the contract or context indicates to the contrary.\nIn the absence of a relationship of employment, for example, in the case of works created by independent contractors, the copyright will vest with the creator or author of the work, in the absence of a written agreement to the contrary, made between the creator of the work and the person or institution for which they are working.\nArchivists conducting the appraisal of institutional documents where there may be some ambiguity over claims of ownership should consult the terms of the contract according to which the work was created, and should encourage institutions to make the ownership of works created by employees or contractors clear in the terms of contract.\nGoing back to the example this chapter begins with, the archive of a scientific institution, in possession of an employee\u2019s papers, must first examine the nature of the records and distinguish between personal papers and institutional papers. In doing so, it should document the process by which this distinction was made, ideally with reference to contractual terms, the records retention schedule and the appraisal policy of the archive."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
